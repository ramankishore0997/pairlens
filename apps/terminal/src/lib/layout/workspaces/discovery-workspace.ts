/**
 * Discovery's workspaces, one per asset class.
 *
 * Discovery used to be a single board, which forced every trader through one
 * arrangement: a perps scalper and a prediction-market trader were tuning the
 * same three columns against each other. So each asset class is its own
 * section with its own workspace — its own persisted layout, its own default
 * board, and its own slice of the layouts menu.
 *
 * `spot` keeps the original storage key. It was the only Discovery layout
 * before sections existed, and that board is a crypto scanner over a
 * sentiment rail, so whatever a user tuned there is, definitionally, their
 * spot board.
 *
 * ## Where the non-spot defaults come from
 *
 * Same rule as the pair route (see `pair-workspace.ts`): every class beyond
 * spot has a family plugin that ships its board through
 * `contributes.workspaces`, and the store entry plus the menu's Default read
 * it from the workspace-template registry — so disabling the family takes it
 * away, tab included. The DEFAULT below is the one thing that cannot be
 * reactive: it seeds the layout reducer on first paint, before any plugin has
 * activated. So it imports the same geometry the plugin ships, statically,
 * from a leaf data module in the plugin package. One source, two paths in.
